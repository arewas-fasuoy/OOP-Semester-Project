## OOP Project
## TOLL PLAZA Management System
## Overview:
Keeping in view the concepts of OOP, I have  designed and developed a Toll Plaza
Management System. The function of this System is to automate all the process at a Toll
Plaza such as calculating tax on the basis of Vehicle Type and generating a receipt. The
following Project is be a GUI based Project.
## Tools Used:
I have Used Visual C++ For the Code and GUI implementation.
## Main Features:
* Checks if a Vehicle is registered or not.
* Report unregistered vehicles.
* Check if all the taxes of a Vehicle are paid or not.
* Include unpaid taxes in receipt.
* Checks if driver license is valid or not.
* Include fine for Invalid license in receipt.
* Calculate Toll tax.
* Generate Receipt.
## Basic Working:
I have used the concepts of file handling along with concepts of OOP to check if a mentioned
vehicles number (input from user) is registered or not (i.e: mentioned in file or not). Same goes
for driver license validity check. If a user input license number or vehicle number is not
mentioned in file it means the car is not registered and it needs to be reported.
