OOP Project
TOLL PLAZA Management System

Overview:
Keeping in view the concepts of OOP, I have designed and developed a Toll Plaza
Management System. The function of this System is to automate all the process at a Toll
Plaza such as calculating tax on the basis of Vehicle Type and generating a receipt. The
following Project will is a GUI based Project.
Tools Used:
I have Used Visual C++ For the Code and GUI implementation.
Main Features:
-Checks if a Vehicle is registered or not.
-Report unregistered vehicles.
-Check if all the taxes of a Vehicle are paid or not.
-Include unpaid taxes in receipt.
-Checks if driver license is valid or not.
-Include fine for Invalid license in receipt.
-Calculate Toll tax.
-Generate Receipt.

Basic Working:
I have used the concepts of file handling along with concepts of OOP to check if a mentioned
vehicles number (input from user) is registered or not (i.e: mentioned in file or not). Same goes
for driver license validity check. If a user input license number or vehicle number is not
mentioned in file it means the car is not registered and it needs to be reported.
Limitation:
The only limitation of this project is that I have limited set of data in the file since there
are millions of cars and for handling that we need larger data sets, but in our project we will be
providing sample data. However, the basic working of code will be same even for large scale
data.
